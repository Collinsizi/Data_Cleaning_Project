Data_Cleaning_Project
A project focused on improving customer data accuracy by identifying and rectifying invalid emails, phone numbers, pseudonyms, fictitious address, age eligibility, and duplicate IDs using Power BI and Power Automate

Data Cleaning Project

 Objective:
The goal of this project is to enhance the quality and accuracy of customer data by identifying and rectifying key data issues such as invalid email addresses, phone numbers, and duplicate customer IDs. By improving data accuracy, we aim to streamline regulatory compliance and improve decision-making within banking operations.

 Tools Used:
- Power BI: Used for data visualization and tracking real-time progress of data cleaning activities.
- Power Automate: Employed to automate workflows for validating and correcting customer data.
- Excel (Advanced): Leveraged for initial data analysis and validation.
- Mock Data: Used for demonstration purposes to showcase the processes without exposing sensitive or real data.

 Process:
1. Data Identification**: 
   - Imported raw customer data, including emails, phone numbers, customer IDs, and addresses, into Power BI and Excel for initial validation.
   
2. **Automated Validation:
   - Created workflows in **Power Automate** to identify and rectify invalid data entries. For example, invalid phone numbers were flagged based on a predefined format, and duplicate customer IDs were detected and reported.
   
3. Real-Time Monitoring:
   - Developed a **Power BI Dashboard** to track the progress of the data cleaning initiative. The dashboard provides real-time updates on the number of records cleaned, remaining anomalies, and overall data quality improvements.
   
4. Collaboration with IT and Compliance Teams:
   - Worked closely with IT and Compliance departments to ensure that the data cleaning efforts align with regulatory requirements, particularly around customer privacy and accuracy.

Results:
- 25% improvement in data accuracy** by eliminating invalid entries for customer emails, phone numbers, and other personal information.
- 15% reduction in duplicate customer IDs, leading to more reliable and consistent customer records.
- Created an automated system for ongoing data validation, which reduced manual intervention and improved efficiency.

 Files:
- mock_customer_data.csv**: An anonymized sample dataset to illustrate the data validation and cleaning process. This mock dataset includes fields such as:
  - Customer_ID
  - Email
  - Phone_Number
  - Address
  - Date_Of_Birth

 Future Enhancements:
- Implement additional validation rules for address standardization and age eligibility.
- Integrate the system with other banking tools to ensure seamless data flow and validation across departments.
